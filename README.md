This is an outdated exercise that deals with opening files and displaying their content as list. Exact instruction of how to use it are as follows:

1. load test.txt where entries are.
2. click on entry or fill fields yourself and click add customer; if address is even remotely correct there won't be an error, otherwise you won't add a customer.
3. click on entry or fill field (Full name for now) yourself and click remove customer; it should select the first customer with that name and delete [! a certain bug prevents variables comparing well to other variables in string values!].
4. save the list with a save button (no directory browsing yet).

An example of this can be seen in: https://github.com/ViktorasZigaras/React-Display-List-obsolete/blob/master/screenshot.png
